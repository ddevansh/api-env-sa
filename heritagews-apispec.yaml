                    lgaDescription: Murray Bridge
                    suburb: WELLINGTON
                    herSignIfClob: Wellington was the site of the earliest and, until
                      the late 1870s, the most important crossing of the River Murray.
                      This former ferry road and stone wall indicate the original
                      route to the old ferry.  They are of significance because they
                      also demonstrate the effects of the immense shifting sandhills
                      which were as much a threat to Wellington's existence as the
                      diversion of traffic to Murray Bridge.  From the early 1850s
                      visitors and residents were troubled by encroaching sand which
                      by the 1880s had almost buried West Wellington.  The line of
                      stones embedded in the roadside is the last vestige of the six
                      feet high walls which were built to withstand the drift.
